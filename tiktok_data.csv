1152 wipes at sams for 22 dollars

8 packs is not a years worth 🤣

I just bought the life time one and it’s called water

30$ and would last maybe 2-3 months

only give me the option to change address. not to add to cart or buy now

Yeah, don’t flush those

They start to smell so bad … used to be a big fan but not great

Gained my commission 🫡

wipes for what?

A year supply of you use half a wipe

""this right here could never do as good of a job as this"" yeah at clogging the toilet 🤣

how you gonna say year supply you don't know how active my asshole is

Imagine being SO insecure as a man that you need “dude wipes.” 💀

DUDE WIPES. BC YALL TOO INSECURE TO USE A BABY WIPE 😂🤡

Don’t listen to the naysayers and their “science” about these wipes. They 100% will flush. They are flushable. Don’t pay attention to the dweebs and their talk of clogged pipes and sewage backing up.

I have a lifetime supply it's called a bidet

year supply. not for me 💩💩💩💩

he's saying they're dishwasher safe bros

Or just buy a bidet

Not a year supply nor is it $15

Eww who wipes their ass 🤮

Semi straight James Charles

Ngl the Cottonelle ones better 🤷🏽‍♂️game is game

the false advertisment lawsuits in a couple years gonna be nice

If 8 packs last for a year you not wiping daily

There’s no such thing as flushable wipes

$15 for the wipes, thousands when you inevitably fuck up your pipes from flushing them

ocupo para ensayar soy músico y lo necesito porfavor 🥺

Carnalito yo compré la jbl extreme 2 en Black Friday tan solo 160 dólares su costo normal es de 300 como ves.

Yo tengo la onn de $120 y la verdad no le pide nada ala jbl tiene buenos bajos y buena calidad de sonido

En cual Walmart es bro ? Dame la ubicación para ir por una oferta

pero no sé comparan cómo la jbl

hase cuatro meses pague 90 dolares por esa y si la recomiendo muy buena

xq jbl es jbl y eso nadie lo va cambiar y si hablamos de calidad jbl buenísima 👌 marca

harman kardon lo mejor

Obviamente estan un poco mas económicas que la Jbl, pero la Jbl es Jbl... Es de excelente calidad 👌

El que no conoce a dios al cualquier santo le resa

Por qué mejor no recomiendas la JBL PartyBox 120 que tienes 💀 que suena mucho mejor que esas…","Post Title: Ofertas en Walmart! 😱 #pvroofer #carnalito #carnalitooficial #ofertas #deals @Walmart

jbl

si pero esas se descargan rapidas con el sol la jbl 4 aguantan hasta 5 horas👍👍👍

la de 1000

Lo barato sale caro por más baratas que estén JBL suena mucho mejor no se distorsiona yo tengo una JBL y se escucha súper bien y las baratas se escuchan horrible ..!!

En qe tienda está mano

Sinceramente aunque no sea jbl se ven bien

son mejores las harman kardon

pero lo importante k la gbl no ocupa mucho espacio ya k es pequeña y de muy buena calidad saludos

Ahí me mandas una carnalito 😁

Esa compré en el wualmart a 128$

Y son buenas

todos sabemos que la jbl es la mejor para que andamos buscando otra que después de un tiempo lla no jalan

Pero la marca

yo compré la flip 6 y la verdad no me gustó lendura muy poco l batería está mejor la 5

“How much is this” 😂

Okay girl 😍😍😍 now we can say we are #jeffreestarapproved✨💖

LMAO! I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU TO DO THE FULL FACE OF DOLLAR TREE MAKEUP AGAIN! The first one you did years ago is one of my favorite videos.

Guess who’s going to Dollar Tree today and I haven’t even watched whole video. Coverage is insane 😯

OHHHH THE NOSTALGIA i remember when you went the old dollar tree reviews 🥺💞

I was waiting for you to review it, I’m convinced! I’m running!!! If it’s JS approved, then it’s worth the long lines at Dollar Tree 😫!

the Dollar Tree had; coworkers, family, and friends question where I got my lashes. not sure what they were called, but I would space them out and it would look very pretty 😊

I was shook at how well she ended up lookin 🫣😅

The fact ive walked the same dollar tree aisles as you now

“Dior, I bet you never thought you’d be on top of dollar tree” killed me 😂😂

Wow, it laid down amazingly better than the top-name brands!! The question is, how did it wear throughout the day🤔

I need to check it out bc my local dollar tree has been lacking lately.

I’m so glad your reviewing Dollar Tree foundation/makeup, unlike M you do connect with your viewers 🥰🥰🥰 Ty!

Omg a whole video of Jeffree Star approved dollar tree make up products would be amazing. Especially for someone like me who knows very little about make up but I want to learn on a budget

“Ik Dior you never thought you be on top of dollar tree but get over it 💁🏻‍♀️” I love you Jeffrey 😂😂😂🤣

not you asking how much it was in dollar tree 😂 ily

Jeffree at dollar tree ❤️turn down for what! 😍🤌

To be fair dollar tree does have stuff creeping up to 3/5$

I bought that prolux foundation and the setting powder for my 18 yr old and she loves it ❤️

“Remember bitch, this is a fucking dollar” 🤣🫶🏽.

hi how are ya!!! ✨

I e used the Prolux and live it

The sigh over 11 shades 😂

The foundation is decent for $1.25! The powder I’ll pass 😂

Nice you should try other places like five below

I feel like this just confirms what I thought about it yayyyyyy

I love Jeffrey Star, since FOREVER 😊🥰

I’m going to the dollar tree now I just searched up their websites omg everything is so cheap! Foundations are 5.99! And moisturizer for 7.99 so cheap rn

7461850300190559534,1737347433,0,5 Costco Price Hacks to know before you go next time! #costco,"I’m more concerned about whether or not I need it. If it’s a jumbo box of canned sardines, I wouldn’t take them for $0.09.

When it’s .69, it’s nice 👌

Not so much interested in how the price ends as I am in how it begins.. 😂😂😂

Wait, so .97 means it’s a sale? I’ve been sleeping on Costco hacks this whole time! 😳

Just because it’s a sale doesn’t mean you get a better deal , we learn about those sales from Black Friday

Asterisk means it’s the lowest price it’s going to be and will not be back in stock when it sells out

you need the product or not, that's simple.

The best thing to find is the price paper taped to the item.

How about if there is no price? Is it free item?

What does the double asterisk mean?

and tiktok being educational again, ty

How about the green tag?

What if the tag is green ?

You missed the .00

Costco definitely makes me over consume. they'll come out with a slightly updated product each year requiring me to toss the old one 😂

I’m more concerned about the numbers on the other side of the decimal point

I stay looking 👀 for 97 at my Costco

At first scroll I seriously thought this was the Tiktok CEO.

WRONG!! the best price are one end in .00! those r clearance items! I got a set of suitcase a few years back for $40

please do the same for Sams club

For my home: Asterisk = The Death Star..

What about Sam’s club

Sounds a lot like Home Depot pricing 😏

I’m only interested if the product is ending *

The sale pricing can vary store to store

A sale?!? No way???

🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 the end was a joke!

Am I losing it, or did their hair lighten in the FL sun?

the agreeing “they’re on sale” took me out 😂😭

So glad to see you doing better ❤️always praying for you 🙏

Okay but every time I see them they are just mini grown ups! Stoooppp growing

Don’t stress over potty training! I did with my first and it was hell and I didn’t with my youngest and it just happened!

I have bought traditional at Walmart & it is indeed cheaper at Walmart (maybe not all) but it’s not on the app,

My winco has Powerade for 88 cents js

Corn bread mix at walkmart is like .50

They have monsters?! I’ve never seen them there lol

My girl math is dollar tree is 5 mins down the road Walmart is 30 mins so I save money on gas

The cake mix is smaller at dollar tree versus Walmart. So depending on what you’re making / how much you need you might end up paying more buying 2 boxes at dollar tree than 1 at Walmart

I think about this alllll the time. Some of the candies & snacks are cheaper at Walmart but I’m surprised by the baking section!","Post Title: Is food cheaper at Walmart or dollar tree ? #dollartree #dollar #dollartreefinds #dollartreehaul #clearance #couponcommunity #deals #dollarstore #barginshopping #walmart

smh where do I shop now 😩😩😩😩

Where’s Aunty Tabitha!!! Is she pulling out of Target? Just bought some of her products!😩😭

Just bought my COSTCO membership an hour ago

So where are we shopping besides target bc I’m a small family and I don’t need Costco volume

Damn I just placed an order for pick up

I spend so much every week with them cause I don’t do Walmart 🤦🏽‍♀️

Costco, Walmart and Amazon just got out the DEI... Im going grocery shopping off shein moving forward 🤣🤣

Most companies copy off each other. You’re going to have to grow and produce your own products to make any difference. That list will be a mile long by the end of the year.

And it’s disheartening because only a few of us are standing on business! 😩I’m with you

dang I left Walmart for Target....Ssseeeessh!

Right i just shopped today…man i go every week

Can't do Target or Walmart? I need a replacement?

😂😂 “After everything that I have done for yall” !!!! …..And it was his “that’s my girl” at the enddd!!! 🙌🏾😭

This is the exact conversation I'm currently having with my daughter cause she just asked me if we can go to target. She isn't grasping the reason yet cause I just told her about spotify

Truth is we all tired

We need a list

My boy said EVERYTHING IN BULK!!!!! lol

I know we’re supposed to be mad right now but that “TARGET DID?!” SENT ME INTO ORBIT🤭🤣

I feel like Costco won’t be far behind 😭

I just read it too 😭 lemme cancel my red card 😞

Not Target! That was my happy place

Costco

Target too? Costco, Aldi,Lidl.

I have a $30 target gift card.. 🤦🏾‍♂️

Target is my safe place. I’m so hurt 😭😭😭

Girl I just purchased a toaster I need to take it back really target really 💀

Big Costco energy!

I cannot wait to see these return videos at target 🤣🤣

no see, what I do, mostly cuz I'm broke... but I only buy clearance items, especially waiting til 70% because I KNOW that's now a loss to the company. letting items salvage is a write off for them.","Post Title: Truth is I’m tired 😩 @Costco Wholesale I’m on my way. #CostcoFinds #DEI #Leadershipo it. #CorporateAccountability #BusinessEthics #DiversityMatters #hrtiktok #techtok #CareerAdvice

Such a cute movie!!

The dollar tree in Lawrence Park/Broomall has them sometimes!

I feel like with shops like dolar tree etc when you are trying to buy something they ""may have "" you need to be there in the morning as they stock up fully over night or in the morning 😩

They are seasonal or when there is a store near by that is trying to unload them. My store only had them for a month or so.

They’re usually with the energy drinks on the shelves for 1.25!! Also, no joke, the prime energy drinks are 👌🏽 and I’m strictly an Alani girl usually

The Dollar Tree stores all around me stink. We never have any of the good stuff I see on TikTok!

It’s hit or miss on the shelves. I also find monster there sometimes.

That my favorite Dollar Tree

Wreck it Ralph always a good choice

yeah the suburbs ones have then on the shelf by the snacks!

Elemental 🥰 my kids are 10 and 16 and they both loved it! I cried

You totally put me onto the Aldi alani dupes I was so tired of paying $2.50 per drink! Thanks queen

I have only found them at one dollar tree near me, they only had them in the summer and they were across from the refrigerator section on an end cap. They were $1.25 and limited flavors.

Finding Nemo or Dory and Inside out is always a good one!

It’s hit or miss. The neshaminy dollar tree had Alani coffees last month, I got a few and then the next time I went they were gone

Annie! My kids love it 🥰

I love going to dollar tree. I’d rather spend $20 on 20 items rather than almost $60 or $70 anywhere else😭

$1.25 on the shelves

If you buy the variety pack at Sam’s club they are $1.39 a piece for Alani

I’m in Michigan but all of the dollar trees near me are hit or miss with the Alanis

I literally love how you still have fun with your kids after a long day!

we watched the Wild robot movie so cute

I tried the Alani dupes (I’m a caffeine addict & drink Alani all the time) and they give me heart palpitations haha they taste decent though

You’re so vibrant. I know you’re so stretched with life but you make it look precious.

Omg those kids plates are so cute

We just watched Wild Robot it was cute!

Go to the Dollar Tree in Lawrence Park shopping center! Way better drink selection and they have had Alani’s and Ready protein water

Albanese FTW

your $1.25 tree is bigger than mine 😂

i need that cardigan.

wait i need to see what the cardigan looks like 😭

I love all of these!!!

So the white people are still shopping at Target I see.

No more Target !!!

Unfortunately, target is no longer a place where I’m willing to spend my money. Money talks.

The irony of them dropping this as they’re removing DEI initiatives

We don’t go there. 👀

“kindness forever” but didnt they just roll back their DEI policies… 👀

shopping at target after they rolled back DEI programs? embarassing

How ironic

Target ain't sitting right with me right now...

We can do better than promoting this right?!

Ok but are they all cropped? Bc EVERYTHING is cropped and us tall girlies don’t need shirts that come to just under our tatas 🤗

I don’t go to target because I think DEI is important ❤️

Who’s gonna tell her we aren’t shopping at Target anymore

I saw a video earlier that someone found tree hut body oils, have you heard of these yet?

what a luck you have in the USA ❤️

can u do a routine with the new pineapple passionfruit dove pls 🫶🏾

I saw Bodycology has the strawberry cheesecake and whipped vanilla body oils now and I need to find them ASAP! 😭💕

do those Walmart wallflower refills fit in the bath and body works plugs?

The nudy rudy soaps were $1 at my Walmart!

I never tried the Walmart fragrance oils for my diffuser; is it worth trying and getting?

Your lashes are so pretty

I need an ocean and beach scented routine!

looking super pretty today:)

do those wall scents fit in the b&bw wall plugs? i had no idea!

Dove Crumbles were not hitting...I was so disappointed

Can you do one for Native Cherry Vanilla Macaroon? (My daughter made herself one with that and Cherry Baby as the basis, so we want to see what you would choose!)

the new dragon fruit dove body wash is acc so good bro (idk if it is new, I js recently saw it at my Walmart)

Can u do a haul plz

So many good finds!! 😍

Do a peach sented routine plssss

I’m missing the vanilla cashmere one

I’ve been looking for a cotton candy lotion but I don’t like blue raspberry

I can’t wait to use all my stuff to try something new

How about grape theme but you pick the store

Omg the eos body washes what!

can you maybe do a cherry vanilla scented shower routine? I love your vids!!

Not me sniffing the phone when you held up the scrub 🤣

Don’t ever grab ice cream first. Because if you grab that first while you are still food shopping or what not it’s going to melt. Always grab ice cream last.

what is the difference btw WIC & food stamp ?

Sooo you get the $10 dozen eggs for free when the rest of us work for a living and can barely afford eggs.

Tortillas/bread freeze really good! I do it all the time to use my benefits up 🫶

if you ever want to spice up the cereal my mom always put maple syrup on me and my siblings as a treat! it’s super yummy 😊

I can’t get those eggs on WIC ?

curious as I'm from Canada and don't have wic, what types of things are there that you wouldn't use? thanks

How does wic work? I’m from Canada so have no clue!

I don't understand not being able to donate ... thats wild

sometimes wic amounts are so excessive it’s so funny to me 😭

“Kisses” 🥺😭❤️

How would they know if you Donate it though or just like give them to a friend who would need them

Get all the tortillas and make chips!!

We can’t get brown eggs on WIC in Montana. I wish we could

In my state you can do the Chex cinnamon

Cinnamon Chex! I always get it for mine (Texas)

Sprinkle cinnamon on the regular life. My kids love it.

Just curious so you can only buy stuff that is off a list of foods?

Once I tried Fairlife milk that’s all I’ll drink now.

I’m from Canada, how do you know what you have left at the end of the month? Is it tractable through an app or something?

the new cheerios blends are on WIC now. You can get cinnamon chex too!

Your WIC lets you get rice Chex!? I wonder if that’s universal I only be getting what I’ve seen at the actual WIC market 🤣

Can you do a bun tutorial

what is WIC?

Girl do your WIC shopping at Publix if you have one near you. You can do the BOGOs.

my mom as a elderly disabled
women get $18 a month. so sad because she can't even get basics. Crazy people have left over $$ to just go and use when others are not getting what they need

Make puppy chow with the peanut butter and Chex mix! So good!!

What state do you live in? If you have a Publix near you and cereal is on bogo you can get a wic approved item then a non wic approved one for free! Same goes for juices ect

tortillas/bread and cheese freeze well

Freeze the tortillas!!","Post Title: Thankful to have these resources available to us!  #shopwithme #walmart #grocery #singlemom #momof4

7478208710192516382,1741156167,0,My fave shirt atm @POPFLEX Active The Perfect Long Sleeve,"Love it but for my body would want a longer fit it seems a bit cropped

I wish I could afford your clothes 😭😭

Can you make a long sleeve that’s not so restrictive on the arms, I love long sleeves but sensory issues 🫠🫠🫠

ship to Brazil 🥺

First!

This is what I’ve been looking for! I enjoy running in long sleeves but don’t want something clinging to my body. So tempted to make my first order!

Why is this not in Western Australia Target stores?!!

omg that looks so cute can you make it a little more cropped as well x

If u design clothes slightly longer it would totally be hajabi approved! Please consider so I can buy from u!❤️❤️

would love if it was a v neck ❤️

PLS MAKE SWIMWEAR FOR THE SUMMER

Why are we still including polyester...

I like it but I would love is if it would be tight 😊

Zero hate, but have you ever thought about the plastic that you’re creating and wearing constantly? We absorb it through our skin and it wrecks our hormones. Have you ever considered natural fabrics?

I got exactly the same style sweater from H&M years ago, except for the tumb part.

i love you but please stop calling things the “perfect” anything it’s never going to be perfect for everyone 😂

i love your videos so much 😭❤️

Too early

Firstttt

Loooove it😍😍😍

No, I don’t think you understand. I’m obsessed.

I love the drawings

please try to stitch Abaya

Can you make something for kids pls

AHH I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS!!! 🥰🥰 IM HERE AND THE 68 COMMENT!!! I LOVE YOU, AND YOUR VIDS SO SO MUCH!!! I

I’m here early!!!

mix a little sugar free pudding with the protein shake before freezing. SO MUCH BETTER!!!!

I really want one but I’m broke 😭

I hate that you have to make the liquid 24 hours in advance. Is there one where it just freezes it as it makes the ice cream?

I’ve been searching for months at the 2 in my town. Went to both today and found one box up by the cashier and got 3! I was so excited!

It’s possible that they were at a different Walmart.

I’d call for sure and talk to a manager

okay and if you did express order it was the delivery driver who shopped it... if you didnt order it express then walmart employees shop it

This happens to me all the time so when it does I go and if I find more than half of what they said was out of stock I take part of the tip away

This happens to me every single time I add something that is a non food item. Like slippers. I tried twice to order slippers and they kept canceling just those. But they had them. 🤨

Most orders are picked way ahead of time so it could be that it was out of stock at the time they shopped your order

I did Walmart pickup and they said my item was out of stock. I packed and went in and they had it.

Absolutely and every time it’s the 5 things I actually need to order 😩

someone once told me that if there's only 1 left on the shelf that delivery and curbside and whatever pickers aren't allowed to grab it for an online order. but idk

I work at aldi and we stock the shelves at different times of day.....so it may be that at the time they were shopping it wasn't on the shelf but stocked later...it doesn't mean the worker is lazy

Sometimes the item can’t be scanned in when they do the order

I can do walmart delivery for groceries but nothing else.

They do it to people all the time..They lazy to look.I'm in Ontario too

I had a Walmart employee once tell me that have a certain amount of items for in store shopping and online shopping because I’ve done this too I was like wtf

I find getting morning deliveries instead of the last ones at night are better. The morning deliveries (for me) almost always have everything im looking for. Which is good bc im asleep to pickout subs

As a Walmart shopper, clothes are so difficult it gives us a location but most the time clothes are not where they tell us they are. I take the extra time to look around. As for the other things

I've had this happen before too and TWICE we have had a driver steal over $300 worth of stuff. Both times were for my toddlers birthday party. I never order a large delivery anymore. We had to file a

It’s happened to me a few times

I have found for non food items a lot of times they say they're out of stock because they don't want to go to the other end of the store.😬

every delivery!

so if you do an express order it's a third party person (like instacart) that does the shopping. if it's an order for a few hours later it'll likely be a Walmart associate.

Yes, this happens all the time to me.

It happens to me with other places also!!

A WM picker/shopper told me if there is only 1 of the item (the last one) they won't pick it. They leave it and say it is out of stock. I don't understand why though.

Ordered a deep freezer and they said it was out of stock. I walked in an hour later and found 3 of what I ordered.

Yes it has happened to me one time

I’m so done with Walmart +. A month after paying for a year membership they cancelled the stores with a grocery store so I can’t even get groceries delivered anymore 💀

Yes this has happened to us as well!","Post Title: Experimenting 🙃 (first world problems I know lol) #walmartdelivery #shopping #shopwithme #walmart #walmartfinds #birthdaygift #jessicajordan44
